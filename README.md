## Detailed Description
In this project I've created a word guessing game called Phrase Hunter.  I used Javascript and OOP to select random phrases which the player tries to guess by clicking the onscreen keyboard

## Notes Regarding Exceeds Expectations
To achieve an Exceeds Expectaitons grade, I have added keyup funcionality so the game can be played with only a keyboard.  I have included directions on the game board for useing the the tab functionality.  There are also style changes to allow for fades in and out of the game play.
